Implementations of some standard reinforcement learning algorithms

- Written in pytorch
- All implentations are encapsulated into a single file
- Algorithms implemted as classes which take OpenAI gym env as inputs
- All classes have uniform interface with `train` and `eval` methods
- All references are given in the code


Algorithms -
- [X] Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG)
- [X] Deep Q Network (DQN)
- [X] Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- [X] Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)
- [X] Soft Actor Critic
- [ ] Proximal Policy Optimization
- [ ] Trust Region Policy Optimization

Features to add -
